ChatGPT changed how millions of people interact with AI. It's an incredible tool for writing, brainstorming, learning, and having conversations. But there's one thing it fundamentally cannot do: interact with your computer.

That's not a criticism—it's a design choice. ChatGPT runs in your browser, and browsers are sandboxed for security. But it means there's a ceiling on what ChatGPT can help you accomplish.

Caipi takes a different approach.

## The Core Difference

| | ChatGPT | Caipi |
|---|---|---|
| **Where it runs** | Browser (web) | Native Mac app |
| **File access** | Upload only (copy/paste) | Direct access to your files |
| **Can run commands** | No | Yes, with your approval |
| **Remembers your projects** | Limited to conversation | Project-based sessions |
| **Works offline** | No | Yes (with local models) |

## What This Means in Practice

### Working with Files

**ChatGPT:** You upload a file or paste its contents. The AI can only see what you explicitly share. If you need to reference multiple files, you're copying and pasting a lot.

**Caipi:** You point it at a folder and say "look at this project." The AI can browse files, understand the structure, and reference anything relevant. When it suggests changes, you see a preview before anything is modified.

### Getting Things Done

**ChatGPT:** You ask for help with a task. ChatGPT gives you instructions or code. You then have to go implement it yourself—open another app, run commands, make edits manually.

**Caipi:** You describe what you need. Caipi can actually do it—run scripts, process data, organize files, make edits. You approve the actions, but you're not the one typing commands.

### Context and Memory

**ChatGPT:** Each conversation is somewhat isolated. ChatGPT has gotten better at memory, but it still doesn't deeply understand your specific files, projects, or workflows.

**Caipi:** Sessions are project-based. The AI maintains context about what you're working on, what files exist, what you've done before. Pick up where you left off.

## When to Use Which

**ChatGPT is great for:**
- General questions and learning
- Writing and editing text
- Brainstorming ideas
- Quick answers when you're away from your computer
- Tasks that don't require file access

**Caipi is better for:**
- Working with local files and projects
- Tasks that require running commands
- Organizing, renaming, or processing files
- Research that involves saving and managing information
- Any workflow where you'd otherwise be copying between AI and your computer

## The Trust Factor

Giving an AI access to your computer sounds scary—and it should give you pause. That's why Caipi shows you exactly what it wants to do before doing it. You see the commands, approve the file changes, and stay in control.

It's not about blindly trusting AI. It's about removing the tedious middleman work while keeping human judgment in the loop.

## Not a Replacement

Caipi isn't trying to replace ChatGPT. They serve different purposes. ChatGPT is a brilliant conversational AI that works anywhere. Caipi is a focused tool for when you need AI that can actually interact with your Mac.

Many people use both: ChatGPT for quick questions on their phone, Caipi for real work at their desk.

## The Bottom Line

ChatGPT showed the world what AI conversation could be. Caipi is the next step: AI that doesn't just talk about doing things, but actually does them.

If you've ever wished ChatGPT could "just do it" instead of telling you how—that's exactly what Caipi is for.
