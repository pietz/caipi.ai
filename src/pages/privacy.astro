<LegalLayout title="Privacy Policy" lastUpdated="January 2026" canonicalPath="/privacy/" description="Caipi's privacy policy. Learn how we handle your data, what we collect, and your rights under GDPR.">
  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Caipi is designed with privacy in mind. The application runs entirely on your local machine,
      and we collect minimal data necessary to provide and improve our service.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      The data controller for Caipi is Paul-Louis Pröve (Germany). You can reach us at
      <a href="mailto:caipi@plpp.de">caipi@plpp.de</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Purchase Information</h3>
    <p>When you purchase Caipi, our payment processor collects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email address (for license delivery and support)</li>
      <li>Payment information (processed securely by our payment provider)</li>
      <li>Country (for tax compliance)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>License Validation</h3>
    <p>When you activate your license, we verify it with our licensing service. This sends:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your license key</li>
      <li>A device identifier (hashed, non-reversible)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Update Checks</h3>
    <p>
      Caipi periodically checks for updates (for example via GitHub Releases). This sends a request
      containing your current version number. Like any web request, the services involved may also
      receive technical data such as your IP address and user agent, which is used only for basic
      security and troubleshooting.
    </p>

      <li>Usage analytics or telemetry</li>
      <li>Browsing history or behavior tracking</li>

    <h2>Legal Bases (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>

      maintain your license), compliance with legal obligations (tax/accounting), and legitimate interests
      (basic security and support).
    </p>
