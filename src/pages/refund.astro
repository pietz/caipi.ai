          <p>
            Caipi is currently in alpha, which means you're getting early access to a product that's
            still evolving. During this phase, you may encounter bugs or incomplete features as we
            continue to develop and improve the software. We appreciate early adopters who understand
            this and are willing to grow with us.
          </p>

            If you experience any issues, please reach out — your feedback helps us improve the
            product for everyone.
