          <p>
            Caipi is currently in alpha, which means you're getting early access to a product that's
            still evolving. We appreciate early adopters who understand this and are willing to grow
            with us.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            That said, we want you to be happy with your purchase. If something isn't working or
            you're having issues, please reach out — we'd love to help make things right.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">Before Requesting a Refund</h2>
          <p>Please make sure:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>You have Claude Code CLI installed and working</li>
            <li>You have an active Claude subscription or API access from Anthropic</li>
            <li>You've reached out to us about any technical issues first</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Note: Caipi requires Claude Code CLI and an active Claude subscription from Anthropic.

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">Refund Processing</h2>
          <p>
            If a refund is granted, it will be processed through Paddle, our payment provider.
            The refund will be credited to your original payment method. Depending on your bank
            or card issuer, it may take 5-10 business days to appear on your statement.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Once a refund is processed, your license will be deactivated.
          </p>
