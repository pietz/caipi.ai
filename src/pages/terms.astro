  <section>
    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By purchasing, downloading, or using Caipi ("the Software"), you agree to be bound by these
      Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Software.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms do not limit any mandatory consumer protection rights you may have under applicable
      law.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. License Grant</h2>
    <p>
      Upon purchase, you are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Caipi on
      your personal devices. This license permits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Installation and use on multiple devices owned by you</li>
      <li>Use for both personal and commercial purposes</li>
      <li>Access to all updates within the purchased major version (e.g., all 1.x updates)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This license does not permit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Redistribution, resale, or sharing of the Software</li>
      <li>Reverse engineering or modification of the Software (except to the extent permitted by law)</li>
      <li>Removal of any proprietary notices or labels</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Caipi requires Claude Code CLI (version 2.0 or higher) and an active Claude subscription or
      API access from Anthropic. Caipi communicates with Claude Code through its official command-line
      interface—all AI requests are processed by and through the Claude Code CLI installed on your
      system. Caipi does not access Anthropic's APIs directly or modify Claude Code's authentication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claude Code is provided by Anthropic and subject to their terms of service. We are not
      affiliated with Anthropic and cannot guarantee the availability or functionality of their
      services. Your use of Claude Code through Caipi remains subject to Anthropic's terms, and
      you are responsible for ensuring your usage complies with those terms.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Payments and Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      All payments are processed through our merchant of record, who handles payment processing,
      invoicing, and sales tax/VAT compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refunds are handled in accordance with our <a href="/refund">Refund Policy</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      To the extent permitted by law, the Software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
      We do not warrant that the Software will be error-free, uninterrupted, or meet your specific
      requirements. Use of the Software is at your own risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caipi interacts with your local file system and can execute commands on your computer.
      While we implement permission controls, you are responsible for reviewing and approving
      actions taken by the Software.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
      special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data,
      business interruption, or loss of profits, arising from your use of the Software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot be excluded or limited under
      applicable law (for example, for intent, gross negligence, or injury to life, body, or health).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Updates and Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update the Software and these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Software
      after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms. Major changes will be communicated
      via email or through the Software.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Termination</h2>

      the right to terminate your license if you violate these terms. Upon termination, you must
      cease all use of the Software and delete all copies.
    </p>
