## What is Caipi?

Caipi is a native macOS app that provides a visual interface for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Instead of working in the terminal, you get:

- **File context sidebar** — see what's being read and edited
- **Rich previews** — view changes, plots, and markdown without switching apps
- **Conversation history** — pick up where you left off
- **Same engine** — powered by the official Claude Code CLI

## Requirements

- macOS 12 or later
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- Active Claude Pro or Max subscription

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)
